# mini-projects
**I try to be better day after day**

Ever since I read Darren Hardy's book  [Compound Effect](http://https://www.amazon.com/Compound-Effect-Darren-Hardy/dp/159315724X "Compound Effect"), I have decided to follow the book's advice and methods.
The purpose of opening this repository is to be able to practice what I am learning in JAVASCRIPT by creating mini-projects.
